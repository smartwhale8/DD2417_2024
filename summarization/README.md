It is obviously very useful to be able to summarize a text automatically. Early research on text summarization focused on extractive summarization, where sentences from the original text are selected and assembled to form the summary, which usually does not lead to very good summaries. The abstractive approach, where the summary is written from scratch, is more challenging but has become realistic with the development of the new neural-network-based methods. In this task, we ask you to write a text summarizer, either by implementing a RNN-based approach with attention, or by using one or several pre-trained transformer models which are then fine-tuned on a summarization dataset. Two available datasets are WikiHow and Amazon Fine Food Reviews, but there are several others as well. The results can be evaluated using some established metric like ROUGE and (to a certain extent) manually.
